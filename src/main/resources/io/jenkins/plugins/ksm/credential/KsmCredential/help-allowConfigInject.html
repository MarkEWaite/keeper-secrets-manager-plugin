<p>
    Checking this optional will cause this credential values to be injected into an environmental variable
    called <b>KSM_CONFIG_BASE64_#</b>. If you are using multiple credentials, and they also  allow for config injection,
    the following environmental variable names will be <b>KSM_CONFIG_BASE64_2</b>, <b>KSM_CONFIG_BASE64_3</b>, etc. The
    profile name will match the name of the description in the Jenkins Credential Manager, if set.
</p>
<p>
    The credential keys and values will be placed into JSON object, then Base64 encoded, and placed in an environmental
    value.

    Tools like the Keeper Secrets Manager CLI can then import this config. This will allow you to use the CLI
    within your pipeline or builder step, if you have installed it. The CLI will automatically check for config
    environmental variables and install them as profile if the CLI does not already have a config.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not going to be using CLI within your pipeline or build, you can leave this checkbox unchecked.
