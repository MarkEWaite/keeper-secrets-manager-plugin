    Checking this optional will cause this credential to be injected into an environmental variable. This
    allows the credential to be used by any applications that uses any of the Keeper Secrets Manager Developer SDKs.
</p>
<p>
    If multiple credential are enabled, only the first will be used by the SDK. However, the Keeper Secrets Manager
    CLI can use multiple credentials.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not going to be using CLI, and an application using the Developer SDKs,
    within your pipeline or build, you can leave this checkbox unchecked.
