<p>
    You can get the One Time Access Token using Keeper Commander.
</p>
<pre>
My Vault> secrets-manager client add --app MyApplication

------------------------------------------------------------------
One Time Access Token: XXXXXXXXXXX
------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
    If you get "This client is locked to a different ip address", create the One Time Access Token with the --unlock-ip
    parameter flag. You'll get this error if your Jenkins instances uses a different gateway than the machine the token
    was created on.
<p>
    Cut-n-paste the token into the UI, along with the Keeper Secrets Manager hostname or region code, and save
    the credential. The save process will redeem the token and fill in the keys. When you reload you can
    view the keys by selecting the Keys button.
</p>
<p>
    If there was an error redeeming the token, it will be displayed in the token field. The credential will not work
    until a successful token redemption takes place, or working keys are manually entered.
</p>
<p>
    Like the name applies, the token can only be used once. You can generate another token from
    Keeper Commander and use it in the One Time Access Token field, if there was a problem or if you wish to replace
    the existing keys.
</p>
<p>
    If you already have a private key, app key and client id. You can click the "View Keys" and manually entry them
    in the fields.
